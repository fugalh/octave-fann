TODO FOR FANN-OCTAVE BINDING
============================

*) It is currently not possible to load fixed-point networks.
   I think this is a feature, and not a bug. What do you think?
*) Perhaps the LearningRate parameter should be removed from fann_create?
*) Make fann_show work!
   *) It is slow (unusable on large networks due to all the redraws).
   *) It doesn't show connections to bias neurons 
      (see http://hauberg.org/octave-fann/net.png).
   *) It would be great if the thickness of the connection lines would
      represent the size of the weights. Kinda like the use of the 
      alphabet in fann_print_connections.
   *) It would be nice if the neurons where drawed as filled points.
   A good starting point is fann_print_connections.
*) fann_read_data: If you read an existing non-data file Octave crashes!
   I think this is a bug i FANN.
*) autotools would be nice, but I don't know the first thing about them.
   (this would be useful to make sure the user has FANN 1.2 (or newer) installed).

*) More testing!!

**       A P I        **

The following functions need work:

5.3. Training
    FANN_TRAIN
    ** This function only performs training on 1 data element.
    ** Do we need this ?? This could be done in fann_train.m - no need for C.

5.4. Training Data
    FANN_SAVE_TRAIN_TO_FIXED (hard! I think...)
    ** One implementation would be to:
    ** in fann_save_train.m:
    **   save the data to a tmp file and call __fann_save_train_to_fixed (doesn't currenty exist).
    ** in __fann_save_train_to_fixed:
    **   load the tmp file.
    **   call fann_save_train_to_fixed

5.5. Options
    FANN_GET_DECIMAL_POINT -- Get the position of the decimal point.
    FANN_GET_MULTIPLIER -- Get the multiplier.
    ** Perhaps we should have a FANN_GET_FIXED_INFO that returns these two?
    ** Since fixed-point networks aren't binded (except support for saving into fixed point)
    ** then this really doesn't make sense.
